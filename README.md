#  Monstodon

<dfn>Monstodon</dfn> is a [MonStrPub][About MonStrPub] implementation, built on top of [Mastodon]'s [ActivityPub][ActivityPub Rocks] implementation, with some changes.
That is, it is a *free*, *open-source* *social-networking* server software based on *open standards* and with support for *cute, federated mon*.

##  Using Monstodon  {#users}

If you're new to Mastodon, you should read the [Mastodon User's Guide](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/User-guide.md), which will take you through both the concepts of federation, and the basic features of the software.

However, no Monstodon server currently is open to the public.
You'll have to wait for the project to come a little further along!

##  Running Monstodon  {#operators}

The process for running Monstodon is the [same as for running Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Running-Mastodon/Production-guide.md).
If you are switching to Monstodon from an existing Mastodon instance, just treat this [the same as you would any update](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Running-Mastodon/Updating-Mastodon-Guide.md).
