#  Contributing Guidelines

Monstodon is *family-developed* software, and intends to stay that way.
If you're looking to *get involved* (beyond simply raising complaints or fixing bugs), you should first *get to know* the KibiMon family by reaching out to [KIBI G√¥](https://glitch.social/@kibi) and/or others in the development team.
We do not have the time, resources, energy, or interest for operating a massive open-source conglomerate of semi-anonymous contributors, so if you're coming here expecting what 90% of FOSS projects seem to aim for, you're out of luck.
(If you *do* have the spoons for this, feel free to start a fork.
Maybe we'll pull things in from time to time üòâ.)

Monstodon is social software built around the premise of getting together with friends and having fun, and Monstodon development looks much the same way.
There is a lot of casual spitballing over various chats, getting together to hang out between developers, and lighthearted @mentions and flirts cropping up on the fediverse and in issues.
But our playful demeanor doesn't mean we aren't serious‚Äî[far from it](https://bluescholars.bandcamp.com/track/southbound).
We are able to bring pleasure to our work precisely *because* we are passionate about it, to the extent that maybe there will be a `#monstodon` `#8tracks` `#fanmix` straight from KibiMon dev one day, who can say üôÉ.

##  I Have An Issue  {#issues}

[Github Issues](https://github.com/kibimon/monstodon/issues) are used for Monstodon bugtracking.
If you can, try to search for existing issues before filing a new one; although if it's a toss-up between not searching and not posting, we'd rather the former.

Not all issues are in-scope for Monstodon‚Äîin particular, any behaviours which are handled by vanilla Mastodon should be discussed on [their issue tracker](https://github.com/kibimon/monstodon/issues), not ours.
We don't expect you to know the difference, so if you post an issue in the wrong place, we'll do our best to direct it to the right one.

You can always raise questions, comments, or concerns with the Monstodon developers directly, and they will do their best to make sure they are appropriately responded to.

##  I Know How To Fix An Issue  {#prs}

Seriously, [get in touch](https://glitch.social/@kibi).
Monstodon doesn't subscribe to the open-source model of nobody talking to anyone ever and PRs from complete strangers showing up on your doorstep unannounced.
If you're developing ActivityPub software (which Monstodon is), it's safe to say that you *probably* have an ActivityPub account, so be a good neighbour and let us know you're around.

**Note for anxious friends:**
The above paragraph is an explicit invitation for you to reach out, so there's no need to worry about suddenly appearing in someone's mentions unannounced.
Just be aware that we're busy folk and it might take us a little while to respond üòú.

**Note for frem strangers:**
If you can't reach out because we blocked you, this invitation does not apply to you ü§ê.

##  I Want To Translate Text  {#localization}

If you speak a language that isn't English and find a missing or incorrect translation, feel free to disregard all of the above and submit your changes whenever and however convenient.
You might find the [Translating guide](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Contributing-to-Mastodon/Translating.md) for Mastodon to be useful in your endeavour.

##  Code of Conduct  {#coc}

Monstodon is family software, which means it operates a little differently than most "organizational" software projects.
The code of conduct can be summed up in three points:

1.  Don't screw us over or make us look bad.

2.  Care and be committed.

3.  If you fuck up, own the fuck up.

Friends contributing to the project should already have a sense of what's appropriate and what "fucking up" entails, and if you're not sure about something, *listen and ask questions* instead of mouthing off.

<div role="note" markdown="block">
**For onlookers and posterity:**
Monstodon is pro-queer, pro-trans software and its developers are strongly opposed to all forms of harrassment and any violation of boundaries without consent.
If an external contributor fucks up badly, you can expect us to do what we can to protect the safety of everyone involved.
If *we* fuck up badly, you should expect (and please hold us to) point ‚Ññ3, above.
